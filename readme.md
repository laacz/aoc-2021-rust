# Advent of Code 2021 - Rust edition

I'll definitely do first few days. Then we'll see. That's because I just started writing in Rust. This will be fun.

Running:

```bash
cargo run --bin day01 -- data/01.txt
cargo run --bin day02 -- data/02.txt
cargo run --bin day03 -- data/03.txt
# Worked on structs and traits
cargo run --bin day04 -- data/04.txt
# Signed math with unsigned and signed ints
cargo run --bin day05 -- data/05.txt
# guess what - u32 overflowed
cargo run --bin day06 -- data/06.txt
# oh, well, I was too lazy to use .map(), so it's a for loop instead
cargo run --bin day07 -- data/07.txt
```
